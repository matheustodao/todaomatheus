I wanted to know how I could build an Android game without studying programming üòÇ </p> \n <p>In begin 2018 I started to study programming, first I studied the logical flow of code with visualg, like pascal but in Portuguese; some months later I got my first steps to learning a language programming, it was our little Python snake. <br/> Oh! I almost forgot I tried to learn Java, but...üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</p>\n <p>In 2019 I found my programming language üòÇ and I did not stop learning. It's <strong>Javascript ‚ù§!</strong> A thing that motivate me, to learn, was Omnistack of Rocketseat (7 days of coding an application) I loved (and I'm still loving) was the javascript stack: <strong>ReactJS, React Native, and NodeJS.</strong> When I saw the power to give us, the possibility to write code in front and backend using the same language! And same year I started to search How I can learn javascript and saw I had to study <i>HTML and CSS</i>, I tagged along.</p> \n <p>Even I studying so much Javascript and React I can't felt my growth, so I'm got at the end of 2020 great investment I join as a student, of course,<a target='_blank' href='https://jstack.com.br'> JStack'</a>,for me, I made the right choice, because I can see what it was left to my growing up and I have learning so much with the course and professor on his Instagram.</p>"
