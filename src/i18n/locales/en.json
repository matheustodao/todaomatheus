I wanted to know how I could build an Android game without studying programming... \n In begin 2018 I started to study programming, first I studied the logical flow of code with visualg, like pascal but in Portuguese; some months later I got my first steps to learning a language programming, it was our little Python snake. \n Oh! I almost forgot I tried to learn Java, but... \n In 2019 I found my programming language üòÇ and I did not stop learning. It's Javascript ‚ù§Ô∏è! A thing that motivate me, to learn, was Omnistack of Rocketseat (7 days of coding an application) I loved (and I'm still loving) was the javascript stack: ReactJS, React Native, and NodeJS. When I saw the power to give us, the possibility to write code in front and backend using the same language! And same year I started to search How I can learn javascript and saw I had to study HTML and CSS, I tagged along. \n Even I studying so much Javascript and React I can't feel my growth, so I'm got at the end of 2020 great investment I join as a student, of course, <a target='_blank' href='https://jstack.com.br'>JStack'</a>,for me, I made the right choice, because I can see what it was left to my growing up and I have learning so much with the course and professor on his Instagram."
